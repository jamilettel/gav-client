# Genetic Algorithm Visualizer - Client

This client is used to visualize Genetic Algorithms that are using a compatible protocol. One example of that can be found in [here](https://www.github.com/jamilettel/gav-server).

## Starting the server

The server uses the NextJS framework, and you can install dependencies and start it with the following commands.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install
# launch in production environment
yarn build && yarn start
#launch in development environment
yarn dev
```

## Usage

When launching the server, you can choose the URL of the GA server that you want to connect to. After that, you can join a session, and then all the required information and interactions you can have will be shown on screen.
